## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

The code is using the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, IPython and seaborn.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I tried to put myself in the shoes of a Airbnb host in Seattle and see how I could improve my Airbnb listing. To do so, I focused the analysis on three questions:

1. What influences the price of Airbnb listings?
2. Which amenities contributes the most to increase a listing rating?
3. How does the number of listings evolve over time? Do the prices follow thisÂ trend?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook that contains the answers to the three questions mentioned above. The notebook will first clean the data, and will then focus on each question separately. For each of them, there is an exploratory analysis of the data, followed by a model for questions 1 and 2, and ends with a visualization of the results.

Markdown cells were used the guide the reader through the steps, as well as to explain the choices and assumptions made throughout the notebook.

The data is also included in the repository.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@julietrinco/three-tips-to-improve-your-seattle-airbnb-host-offering-a103169404ed).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thank you first to Airbnb for sharing their data, you can find more information about it here on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) . Second, I would like to acknowledge Udacity for their great Data Scientist nanodegree of which this project is part of. Finally, I would like to thank Nicolas Essipova, my mentor for this Data Scientist nanodegree who have helped me out throughout this project.
